## Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to Quibbble!

If you are looking to contribute to the Quibbble ecosystem then you are in the right place. Below are a list of resources to help get you started:
- [go-boardgame](https://github.com/quibbble/go-boardgame) provides the basic scaffolding for all Quibbble games. If you are looking to create a new game then start here. Also checkout the [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/quibbble/go-boardgame/tree/main/examples/tictactoe) code for a simple example.
- [go-quibbble](https://github.com/quibbble/go-quibbble) provides the networking layer for Quibbble. It exposes a REST API for game creation/management and a Websockets API for game play. New games can seamlessly be added to this service as long as they follow the [go-boardgame](https://github.com/quibbble/go-boardgame) standards.

Please note that the frontend is not currently open-source but will likely be made so in the future. If you would like access to those resources then please shoot a message to dev@quibbble.com.
